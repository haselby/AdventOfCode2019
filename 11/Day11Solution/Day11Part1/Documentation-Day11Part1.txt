You'll need to build a new emergency hull painting robot. 
The robot needs to be able to move around on the grid of square panels on the side of your ship,
detect the color of its current panel, and paint its current panel black or white. 
(All of the panels are currently black.)


white panel = 0  (.)
black panel = 1  (#)

turn 90 degrees left (ccw) = 0
turn 90 degrees right (cw) = 1

Input Instructions --> access camera --> output color panel, direction the robot should turn



After the robot turns, it should always move forward exactly one panel. 

The robot starts facing up.

The robot will continue running for a while like this and halt when it is finished drawing. 
Do not restart the Intcode computer inside the robot during this process.

Start Intcode computer initializing it with puzzle input
It will paint first, then move (So when it haults, it should not paint (again?) the panel it is currently over
It will run for a while asking for input, for which you must provide color of the panel it is currently over
the program will eventually hault

After which you will need to provide the number of panels that were painted at least once.
Note a panel could be painted white mulitple times, but only counted once.
Also a panel could be painted white, then black, then white again

Robot has both white and black paint.

inital input will be 0 at the start of the intcode program since the space craft

So basically you need to collect the output pairs from the computer, then process them to elimated panels
that were already counted once.

Also you need to resurrect your intcode computer from day 9 puzzle.

The initial color of any panel on your ship is encoded in your puzzle input. (Rather than initially assuming the whole ship is white or is black)
